Introduction:

The

Greatest

Show

On

Earth

Ispent

my

college

years

working

as

a

valet

at

a

nice

hotel

in

Los

Angeles.

One

frequent

guest

was

a

technology

executive.

He

was

a

genius,

having

designed

and

patented

a

key

component

in

Wi-Fi

routers

in

his

20s.

He

had

started

and

sold

several

companies.

He

was

wildly

successful.

He

also

had

a

relationship

with

money

I’

d

describe

as

a

mix

of

insecurity

and

childish

stupidity.

He

carried

a

stack

of

hundred

dollar

bills

several

inches

thick.

He

showed

it

to

everyone

who

wanted

to

see

it

and

many

who

didn’

t.

He

bragged

openly

and

loudly

about

his

wealth,

often

while

drunk

and

always

apropos

of

nothing.

One

day

he

handed

one

of

my

colleagues

several

thousand

dollars

of

cash

and

said,

“

Go

to

the

jewelry

store

down

the

street

and

get

me

a

few

$

1,000

gold

coins.

”

An

hour

later,

gold

coins

in

hand,

the

tech

executive

and

his

buddies

gathered

around

by

a

dock

overlooking

the

Pacific

Ocean.

They

then

proceeded

to

throw

the

coins

into

the

sea,

skipping

them

like

rocks,

cackling

as

they

argued

whose

went

furthest.

Just

for

fun.

Days

later

he

shattered

a

lamp

in

the

hotel’

s

restaurant.

A

manager

told

him

it

was

a

$

500

lamp

and

he’

d

have

to

replace

it.

“

You

want

five

hundred

dollars?

”

the

executive

asked

incredulously,

while

pulling

a

brick

of

cash

from

his

pocket

and

handing

it

to

the

manager.

“

Here’

s

five

thousand

dollars.

Now

get

out

of

my

face.

And

don’

t

ever

insult

me

like

that

again.

”

You

may

wonder

how

long

this

behavior

could

last,

and

the

answer

was

“

not

long.

”

I

learned

years

later

that

he

went

broke.

The

premise

of

this

book

is

that

doing

well

with

money

has

a

little

to

do

with

how

smart

you

are

and

a

lot

to

do

with

how

you

behave.

And

behavior

is

hard

to

teach,

even

to

really

smart

people.

A

genius

who

loses

control

of

their

emotions

can

be

a

financial

disaster.

The

opposite

is

also

true.

Ordinary

folks

with

no

financial

education

can

be

wealthy

if

they

have

a

handful

of

behavioral

skills

that

have

nothing

to

do

with

formal

measures

of

intelligence.

My

favorite

Wikipedia

entry

begins:

“

Ronald

James

Read

was

an

American

philanthropist,

investor,

janitor,

and

gas

station

attendant.

”

Ronald

Read

was

born

in

rural

Vermont.

He

was

the

first

person

in

his

family

to

graduate

high

school,

made

all

the

more

impressive

by

the

fact

that

he

hitchhiked

to

campus

each

day.

For

those

who

knew

Ronald

Read,

there

wasn’

t

much

else

worth

mentioning.

His

life

was

about

as

low

key

as

they

come.

Read

fixed

cars

at

a

gas

station

for

25

years

and

swept

floors

at

JCPenney

for

17

years.

He

bought

a

two-bedroom

house

for

$

12,000

at

age

38

and

lived

there

for

the

rest

of

his

life.

He

was

widowed

at

age

50

and

never

remarried.

A

friend

recalled

that

his

main

hobby

was

chopping

firewood.

Read

died

in

2014,

age

92.

Which

is

when

the

humble

rural

janitor

made

international

headlines.

2,813,503

Americans

died

in

2014.

Fewer

than

4,000

of

them

had

a

net

worth

of

over

$

8

million

when

they

passed

away.

Ronald

Read

was

one

of

them.

In

his

will

the

former

janitor

left

$

2

million

to

his

stepkids

and

more

than

$

6

million

to

his

local

hospital

and

library.

Those

who

knew

Read

were

baffled.

Where

did

he

get

all

that

money?

It

turned

out

there

was

no

secret.

There

was

no

lottery

win

and

no

inheritance.

Read

saved

what

little

he

could

and

invested

it

in

blue

chip

stocks.

Then

he

waited,

for

decades

on

end,

as

tiny

savings

compounded

into

more

than

$

8

million.

That’

s

it.

From

janitor

to

philanthropist.

A

few

months

before

Ronald

Read

died,

another

man

named

Richard

was

in

the

news.

Richard

Fuscone

was

everything

Ronald

Read

was

not.

A

Harvard-educated

Merrill

Lynch

executive

with

an

MBA,

Fuscone

had

such

a

successful

career

in

finance

that

he

retired

in

his

40s

to

become

a

philanthropist.

Former

Merrill

CEO

David

Komansky

praised

Fuscone’

s

“

business

savvy,

leadership

skills,

sound

judgment

and

personal

integrity.

”

¹

Crain’

s

business

magazine

once

included

him

in

a

“

40

under

40

”

list

of

successful

businesspeople.²

But

then—like

the

gold-coin-skipping

tech

executive—everything

fell

apart.

In

the

mid-2000s

Fuscone

borrowed

heavily

to

expand

an

18,000-square

foot

home

in

Greenwich,

Connecticut

that

had

11

bathrooms,

two

elevators,

two

pools,

seven

garages,

and

cost

more

than

$

90,000

a

month

to

maintain.

Then

the

2008

financial

crisis

hit.

The

crisis

hurt

virtually

everyone’

s

finances.

It

apparently

turned

Fuscone’

s

into

dust.

High

debt

and

illiquid

assets

left

him

bankrupt.

“

I

currently

have

no

income,

”

he

allegedly

told

a

bankruptcy

judge

in

2008.

First

his

Palm

Beach

house

was

foreclosed.

In

2014

it

was

the

Greenwich

mansion’

s

turn.

Five

months

before

Ronald

Read

left

his

fortune

to

charity,

Richard

Fuscone’

s

home—where

guests

recalled

the

“

thrill

of

dining

and

dancing

atop

a

see-through

covering

on

the

home’

s

indoor

swimming

pool

”

—was

sold

in

a

foreclosure

auction

for

75

%

less

than

an

insurance

company

figured

it

was

worth.³

Ronald

Read

was

patient;

Richard

Fuscone

was

greedy.

That’

s

all

it

took

to

eclipse

the

massive

education

and

experience

gap

between

the

two.

The

lesson

here

is

not

to

be

more

like

Ronald

and

less

like

Richard—though

that’

s

not

bad

advice.

The

fascinating

thing

about

these

stories

is

how

unique

they

are

to

finance.

In

what

other

industry

does

someone

with

no

college

degree,

no

training,

no

background,

no

formal

experience,

and

no

connections

massively

outperform

someone

with

the

best

education,

the

best

training,

and

the

best

connections?

I

struggle

to

think

of

any.

It

is

impossible

to

think

of

a

story

about

Ronald

Read

performing

a

heart

transplant

better

than

a

Harvard-trained

surgeon.

Or

designing

a

skyscraper

superior

to

the

best-trained

architects.

There

will

never

be

a

story

of

a

janitor

outperforming

the

world’

s

top

nuclear

engineers.

But

these

stories

do

happen

in

investing.

The

fact

that

Ronald

Read

can

coexist

with

Richard

Fuscone

has

two

explanations.

One,

financial

outcomes

are

driven

by

luck,

independent

of

intelligence

and

effort.

That’

s

true

to

some

extent,

and

this

book

will

discuss

it

in

further

detail.

Or,

two

(

and

I

think

more

common

),

that

financial

success

is

not

a

hard

science.

It’

s

a

soft

skill,

where

how

you

behave

is

more

important

than

what

you

know.

I

call

this

soft

skill

the

psychology

of

money.

The

aim

of

this

book

is

to

use

short

stories

to

convince

you

that

soft

skills

are

more

important

than

the

technical

side

of

money.

I’

ll

do

this

in

a

way

that

will

help

everyone—from

Read

to

Fuscone

and

everyone

in

between—make

better

financial

decisions.

These

soft

skills

are,

I’

ve

come

to

realize,

greatly

underappreciated.

Finance

is

overwhelmingly

taught

as

a

math-based

field,

where

you

put

data

into

a

formula

and

the

formula

tells

you

what

to

do,

and

it’

s

assumed

that

you’

ll

just

go

do

it.

This

is

true

in

personal

finance,

where

you’

re

told

to

have

a

six-month

emergency

fund

and

save

10

%

of

your

salary.

It’

s

true

in

investing,

where

we

know

the

exact

historical

correlations

between

interest

rates

and

valuations.

And

it’

s

true

in

corporate

finance,

where

CFOs

can

measure

the

precise

cost

of

capital.

It’

s

not

that

any

of

these

things

are

bad

or

wrong.

It’

s

that

knowing

what

to

do

tells

you

nothing

about

what

happens

in

your

head

when

you

try

to

do

it.

Two

topics

impact

everyone,

whether

you

are

interested

in

them

or

not:

health

and

money.

The

health

care

industry

is

a

triumph

of

modern

science,

with

rising

life

expectancy

across

the

world.

Scientific

discoveries

have

replaced

doctors’

old

ideas

about

how

the

human

body

works,

and

virtually

everyone

is

healthier

because

of

it.

The

money

industry—investing,

personal

finance,

business

planning—is

another

story.

Finance

has

scooped

up

the

smartest

minds

coming

from

top

universities

over

the

last

two

decades.

Financial

Engineering

was

the

most

popular

major

in

Princeton’

s

School

of

Engineering

a

decade

ago.

Is

there

any

evidence

it

has

made

us

better

investors?

I

have

seen

none.

Through

collective

trial

and

error

over

the

years

we

learned

how

to

become

better

farmers,

skilled

plumbers,

and

advanced

chemists.

But

has

trial

and

error

taught

us

to

become

better

with

our

personal

finances?

Are

we

less

likely

to

bury

ourselves

in

debt?

More

likely

to

save

for

a

rainy

day?

Prepare

for

retirement?

Have

realistic

views

about

what

money

does,

and

doesn’

t

do,

to

our

happiness?

I’

ve

seen

no

compelling

evidence.

Most

of

the

reason

why,

I

believe,

is

that

we

think

about

and

are

taught

about

money

in

ways

that

are

too

much

like

physics

(

with

rules

and

laws

)

and

not

enough

like

psychology

(

with

emotions

and

nuance

).

And

that,

to

me,

is

as

fascinating

as

it

is

important.

Money

is

everywhere,

it

affects

all

of

us,

and

confuses

most

of

us.

Everyone

thinks

about

it

a

little

differently.

It

offers

lessons

on

things

that

apply

to

many

areas

of

life,

like

risk,

confidence,

and

happiness.

Few

topics

offer

a

more

powerful

magnifying

glass

that

helps

explain

why

people

behave

the

way

they

do

than

money.

It

is

one

of

the

greatest

shows

on

Earth.

My

own

appreciation

for

the

psychology

of

money

is

shaped

by

more

than

a

decade

of

writing

on

the

topic.

I

began

writing

about

finance

in

early

2008.

It

was

the

dawn

of

a

financial

crisis

and

the

worst

recession

in

80

years.

To

write

about

what

was

happening,

I

wanted

to

figure

out

what

was

happening.

But

the

first

thing

I

learned

after

the

financial

crisis

was

that

no

one

could

accurately

explain

what

happened,

or

why

it

happened,

let

alone

what

should

be

done

about

it.

For

every

good

explanation

there

was

an

equally

convincing

rebuttal.

Engineers

can

determine

the

cause

of

a

bridge

collapse

because

there’

s

agreement

that

if

a

certain

amount

of

force

is

applied

to

a

certain

area,

that

area

will

break.

Physics

isn’

t

controversial.

It’

s

guided

by

laws.

Finance

is

different.

It’

s

guided

by

people’

s

behaviors.

And

how

I

behave

might

make

sense

to

me

but

look

crazy

to

you.

The

more

I

studied

and

wrote

about

the

financial

crisis,

the

more

I

realized

that

you

could

understand

it

better

through

the

lenses

of

psychology

and

history,

not

finance.

To

grasp

why

people

bury

themselves

in

debt

you

don’

t

need

to

study

interest

rates;

you

need

to

study

the

history

of

greed,

insecurity,

and

optimism.

To

get

why

investors

sell

out

at

the

bottom

of

a

bear

market

you

don’

t

need

to

study

the

math

of

expected

future

returns;

you

need

to

think

about

the

agony

of

looking

at

your

family

and

wondering

if

your

investments

are

imperiling

their

future.

I

love

Voltaire’

s

observation

that

“

History

never

repeats

itself;

man

always

does.

”

It

applies

so

well

to

how

we

behave

with

money.

In

2018,

I

wrote

a

report

outlining

20

of

the

most

important

flaws,

biases,

and

causes

of

bad

behavior

I’

ve

seen

affect

people

when

dealing

with

money.

It

was

called

The

Psychology

of

Money,

and

over

one

million

people

have

read

it.

This

book

is

a

deeper

dive

into

the

topic.

Some

short

passages

from

the

report

appear

unaltered

in

this

book.

What

you’

re

holding

is

20

chapters,

each

describing

what

I

consider

to

be

the

most

important

and

often

counterintuitive

features

of

the

psychology

of

money.

The

chapters

revolve

around

a

common

theme,

but

exist

on

their

own

and

can

be

read

independently.

It’

s

not

a

long

book.

You’

re

welcome.

Most

readers

don’

t

finish

the

books

they

begin

because

most

single

topics

don’

t

require

300

pages

of

explanation.

I’

d

rather

make

20

short

points

you

finish

than

one

long

one

you

give

up

on.

On

we

go.
