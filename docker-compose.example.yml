# Be sure to replace <your_subscription_key> and <your_region> with your actual
# Azure Text-to-Speech API credentials. Also, replace your_book.epub with the
# name of your EPUB file, and audiobook_output with the name of the directory
# where you want to save the output files.

# After creating and saving the `docker-compose.yml` file, run the
# `docker-compose up` command in the same directory to pull the image and start
# the conversion process.

# You can then try to modify volumes to fit your need.
